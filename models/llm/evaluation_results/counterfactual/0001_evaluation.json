    "medical_accuracy": "The explanation is largely accurate. The understanding of ST depression, exercise-induced angina, and maximum heart rate in the context of cardiovascular disease is correct. However, the claim that regular aerobic exercise can increase the maximum heart rate is debatable as maximum heart rate is often determined by age and genetics.",
    "clinical_relevance": "The explanation is clinically relevant. The explanation addresses key factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease and provides context on why they are important. The significance of each feature in relation to the cardiovascular disease risk prediction is clearly outlined.",
    "actionability": "The explanation provides specific, actionable steps the patient can take to reduce their cardiovascular disease risk. It includes changes to diet, exercise, stress management, and having regular check-ups.",
    "completeness": "The explanation is complete. It identifies the key modifiable features, explains why they are important, and provides recommendations on how to manage each one. It also explains how making these changes could reduce the patient's cardiovascular disease risk and highlights the importance of a comprehensive approach.",
    "clarity": "The explanation is clear and easy to understand. It uses non-technical language and explains medical terms in a way that a patient could understand.",
    "guideline_alignment": "The recommended changes align with general guidelines for reducing cardiovascular disease risk. However, the suggestion to increase maximum heart rate may not be in line with some guidelines, as maximum heart rate is largely determined by factors such as age and genetics and isn't typically an aspect of fitness that can be trained or increased."
