You are a medical AI assistant helping to interpret cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk predictions.

Patient Information:
- ID: P0003
- Age: 54 years
- Sex: Male

Clinical Features:
- Chest Pain Type: typical angina
- Resting Blood Pressure: 110 mm Hg
- Serum Cholesterol: 239 mg/dl
- Fasting Blood Sugar: Normal (â‰¤120 mg/dl)
- Resting ECG: having ST-T wave abnormality
- Maximum Heart Rate: 126 bpm
- Exercise-Induced Angina: Yes
- ST Depression: 2.8
- ST Slope: flat
- Number of Major Vessels: 1
- Thalassemia: reversible defect

Model Predictions:
1. Random Forest Model:
   - Prediction: Low CVD Risk
   - Confidence: 1.00
   - Top Contributing Factors (positive SHAP values):
     Resting Blood Pressure (0.0204), Resting ECG (0.0106), Age (0.0005)
   - Top Risk-Reducing Factors (negative SHAP values):
     ST Depression (-0.1024), Chest Pain Type (-0.0997), Number of Major Vessels (-0.0919)

2. XGBoost Model:
   - Prediction: Low CVD Risk
   - Confidence: 0.99
   - Top Contributing Factors (positive SHAP values):
     Resting Blood Pressure (0.6229), Resting ECG (0.2068), Age (0.0699)
   - Top Risk-Reducing Factors (negative SHAP values):
     ST Depression (-1.6867), Chest Pain Type (-1.2386), Number of Major Vessels (-1.1357)

Please provide:
1. A clinical interpretation of the patient's CVD risk based on the model predictions
2. An explanation of the key factors contributing to the risk assessment
3. Specific recommendations for risk management based on the patient's profile
4. A discussion of any uncertainties or limitations in the prediction
5. Suggestions for additional tests or information that might improve the assessment

Your response should be in clear, non-technical language that a healthcare provider could use to explain the situation to a patient.
