**Summary of Current Risk Status:**

The patient's risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently predicted to be low based on the Random Forest and XGBoost models. However, there are certain key factors that contribute to cardiovascular health that need to be addressed to maintain this low risk.

**Key Risk Factors:**

The primary risk factors in this case include:

- **ST Depression:** This is associated with decreased blood flow to the heart, which can indicate heart disease.
  
- **Maximum Heart Rate:** A lower-than-average maximum heart rate could indicate less efficient heart function.
  
- **Exercise-Induced Angina:** This is a symptom of coronary artery disease, and its presence can increase CVD risk.

**Specific, Actionable Recommendations:**

- **ST Depression:** Regular monitoring and medication adjustments can help manage this. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are often prescribed. Regular cardiac evaluations are also important. 

- **Maximum Heart Rate:** Regular aerobic exercise, like walking or swimming, can help increase heart rate over time. The patient should aim for a heart rate within the range of 120-160 bpm during exercise.

- **Exercise-Induced Angina:** Lifestyle modifications like quitting smoking, eating a heart-healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight could help. Regular exercise should be done under the guidance of a healthcare provider. Medications can also be used.

These changes should be implemented under the supervision of a healthcare provider. Addressing these features together might have a greater impact than addressing them individually. For example, increasing physical activity can help both increase heart rate and decrease angina.

**Expected Outcomes:**

If these changes are implemented, the patient's CVD risk could significantly decrease. Improvements may be seen within a few months of medication adjustment, but individual response times vary. The exact impact can't be quantified without re-running the prediction models.

**References to Relevant Clinical Guidelines:**

As per the ACC/AHA guidelines, the patient's blood pressure is in the hypertensive crisis range, and her cholesterol level is high, both of which are significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Immediate medical intervention is required for a hypertensive crisis. Antihypertensive medication should be started and adjusted until the target blood pressure of <130/80 mm Hg is achieved.

Statin therapy is recommended for adults 40-75 years with LDL cholesterol â‰¥190 mg/dL. Lifestyle changes including a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, avoidance of tobacco products, and limiting alcohol intake should also be encouraged.

Please remember that while the models' predictions are highly confident, they are not 100% accurate and are based on the data given. Other factors not included in this data, such as family history, lifestyle habits, and other health conditions, can also influence CVD risk.
