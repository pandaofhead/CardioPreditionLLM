1. Modifiable Feature Impact:

   - ST Depression: If the ST depression is reduced from 3.4mm to a value below 1mm, the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) may decrease. ST depression is associated with decreased blood flow to the heart, which can indicate heart disease.
   
   - Maximum Heart Rate: If the maximum heart rate increases from 117 bpm to a healthy range of 120-160 bpm (for her age), the CVD risk might decrease. A lower-than-average maximum heart rate could indicate a less efficient heart function.
   
   - Exercise-Induced Angina: If exercise-induced angina changed from present (Yes) to absent (No), it might lower the patient's CVD risk. Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease, and its absence would indicate better heart health.

2. Recommendations:

   - ST Depression: Regular monitoring and medication adjustments can help manage this. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are often prescribed. Regular cardiac evaluations are also important. Improvements may be seen within a few months of medication adjustment, but individual response times vary.
   
   - Maximum Heart Rate: Regular aerobic exercise, like walking or swimming, can help increase heart rate over time. The patient should aim for a heart rate within the range of 120-160 bpm during exercise. Progress can usually be seen in a few weeks to a few months.
   
   - Exercise-Induced Angina: Lifestyle modifications like quitting smoking, eating a heart-healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight could help. Regular exercise should be done under the guidance of a healthcare provider. Medications can also be used. Changes may be noticeable within a few weeks to months.

3. If all these changes are implemented, the patient's CVD risk could significantly decrease. However, the exact impact can't be quantified without re-running the prediction models.

4. Interactions between features:

   - Addressing these features together might have a greater impact than addressing them individually. For example, increasing physical activity can help both increase heart rate and decrease angina.
   
   - However, it is important to monitor ST depression during exercise, as excessive exercise can potentially worsen this condition. The healthcare provider should provide a balanced exercise plan considering all these factors.

Remember, these changes should be implemented under the supervision of a healthcare provider.
