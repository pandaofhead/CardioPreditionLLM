1. Counterfactual Explanations:

   - ST Depression: If the ST depression, currently at 4.2 mm, is reduced to less than 2 mm, it may significantly lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. ST depression is an indication of myocardial ischemia, or reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, which increases CVD risk. Lowering ST depression could indicate better heart health.

   - Exercise-Induced Angina: Currently, the patient doesn't experience exercise-induced angina, which is chest pain or discomfort during physical activity. If the patient were to develop this symptom, it would increase their CVD risk. Keeping this symptom at bay is crucial for maintaining their heart health.

   - Maximum Heart Rate: The patient's maximum heart rate during exercise is currently 145 bpm. If this can be increased to a higher level, say 160 bpm, under safe conditions, it could indicate better cardiovascular fitness and thus lower CVD risk.

2. Recommendations:

   - ST Depression: Regular exercise, a healthy diet, stress management, and medication (if prescribed by a doctor) can help reduce ST depression. It's recommended to have regular heart check-ups to monitor this. Changes may be seen over several months. Challenges include maintaining a consistent lifestyle change, but regular check-ups and a good support system can help overcome this.

   - Exercise-Induced Angina: Continue monitoring for any chest discomfort during physical activity. If such symptoms appear, seek immediate medical attention. Regular exercise, quitting smoking, and controlling blood pressure and cholesterol levels can help prevent this.

   - Maximum Heart Rate: Regular aerobic exercise can help increase the maximum heart rate during exercise. Start slowly and increase the intensity of workouts over time under a physician's guidance. Improvement may be seen over several weeks to months.

3. If all the recommended changes are implemented and maintained, the patient's risk score could significantly decrease. However, the exact quantification of this change may vary depending on individual response to lifestyle modifications and treatments.

4. Addressing these features together will have a greater impact. Regular exercise not only reduces ST depression but also helps increase maximum heart rate and keep angina in check. Similarly, a healthy diet and stress management will contribute positively to all three factors. Thus, a comprehensive approach to lifestyle changes will provide the best outcome in reducing CVD risk.
